  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

    

    Could try punching
    my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

    

    What
    should I do?

    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak
    my way to the emergency exit.
